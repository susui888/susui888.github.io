- **Concurrency**: Utilized **Swift Structured Concurrency (Async/Await)** for efficient, non-blocking data fetching and parallel mapping.
- **Data Persistence**: Leveraging **SwiftData** for modern, declarative local storage and seamless data syncing.
- **Reactive UI**: Built a fluid UI using **SwiftUI** and **Combine**, ensuring real-time state synchronization across all views.
- **Testing**: Robust test suite using **XCTest** (or Swift Testing) covering core business logic and repository mapping.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **UI**: SwiftUI, SF Symbols, Custom ViewModifiers.
- **Logic**: MVVM, Use Cases, Async/Await, Combine.
- **Data**: URLSession, SwiftData, Codable.

## 📊 Core Features
